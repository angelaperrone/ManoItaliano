# Mano Italiano
A 3D Unity game for people who talk with their hands

I am Italian and I have a tendency to talk with my hands. A lot. And because of this, I have knocked over my fair share of glassware and liquids that get in the way of my physical talking. No discussion ends dry, shatter-less or unstained. I want to create an interactive piece with unity where one can talk and see just how destructive their hand gestures can be.
